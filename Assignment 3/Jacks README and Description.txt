Description:

In this project, we created a Python script that created 3 text files using the full text of Aliceâ€™s Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll. The first file, allwords.txt, contains all words in the novel after removing non-letter characters and converting to lowercase. The second file, uniquewords.txt, contains a list of each unique word in the novel. The third file, wordfrequency.txt, contains a list of the amount of unique words in the novel that occurred at each frequency.

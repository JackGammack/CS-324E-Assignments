chapter
the
alice
was
beginning
to
get
very
tired
of
sitting
by
her
sister
on
the
of
having
nothing
to
or
twice
she
had
peeped
into
the
book
her
sister
was
it
had
no
pictures
or
conversations
in
what
is
the
use
of
a
alice
or
so
she
was
considering
in
her
own
mind
as
she
the
hot
day
made
her
feel
very
sleepy
and
the
pleasure
of
making
a
be
worth
the
trouble
of
getting
up
and
picking
the
suddenly
a
white
rabbit
with
pink
eyes
ran
close
by
there
was
nothing
so
very
remarkable
in
did
alice
think
it
so
very
much
out
of
the
way
to
hear
the
rabbit
say
to
oh
shall
be
she
thought
it
over
occurred
to
her
that
she
ought
to
have
wondered
at
at
the
time
it
all
seemed
quite
when
the
rabbit
actually
took
a
watch
out
of
its
looked
at
then
hurried
alice
started
to
her
it
flashed
across
her
mind
that
she
had
never
before
seen
a
rabbit
with
either
a
a
watch
to
take
out
of
burning
with
ran
across
the
field
after
fortunately
was
just
in
time
to
see
it
pop
down
a
large
the
in
another
moment
down
went
alice
after
once
considering
how
in
the
world
she
was
to
get
out
the
straight
on
like
a
tunnel
for
some
then
dipped
suddenly
suddenly
that
alice
had
not
a
moment
to
think
about
stopping
herself
before
she
found
herself
falling
down
a
very
deep
either
the
well
was
very
she
fell
very
she
had
plenty
of
time
as
she
went
down
to
look
about
her
and
to
wonder
what
was
going
to
happen
she
tried
to
look
down
and
make
out
what
she
was
coming
it
was
too
dark
to
see
she
looked
at
the
sides
of
the
noticed
that
they
were
filled
with
cupboards
and
and
there
she
saw
maps
and
pictures
hung
upon
took
down
a
jar
from
one
of
the
shelves
as
she
was
labelled
but
to
her
great
disappointment
it
was
did
not
like
to
drop
the
jar
for
fear
of
killing
managed
to
put
it
into
one
of
the
cupboards
as
she
fell
past
alice
to
such
a
fall
as
shall
think
nothing
of
tumbling
down
brave
think
me
at
i
anything
about
if
i
fell
off
the
top
of
the
was
very
likely
the
fall
never
come
to
an
wonder
how
many
miles
by
this
said
must
be
getting
somewhere
near
the
centre
of
the
me
would
be
four
thousand
miles
you
had
learnt
several
things
of
this
sort
in
her
lessons
in
the
though
this
was
not
a
very
good
opportunity
for
showing
off
her
there
was
no
one
to
listen
to
it
was
good
practice
to
say
it
about
the
right
i
wonder
what
latitude
or
longitude
had
no
idea
what
latitude
longitude
thought
they
were
nice
grand
words
to
presently
she
began
wonder
if
i
shall
fall
right
through
the
funny
to
come
out
among
the
people
that
walk
with
their
heads
was
rather
glad
there
was
no
one
it
at
all
the
right
i
shall
have
to
ask
them
what
the
name
of
the
country
this
new
zealand
or
she
tried
to
curtsey
as
she
as
through
the
you
think
you
could
manage
what
an
ignorant
little
girl
me
for
do
to
i
shall
see
it
written
up
was
nothing
else
to
alice
soon
began
talking
miss
me
very
much
should
the
hope
her
saucer
of
milk
at
my
wish
you
were
down
here
with
are
no
mice
in
the
you
might
catch
a
like
a
do
cats
eat
here
alice
began
to
get
rather
went
on
saying
to
a
dreamy
sort
of
cats
eat
cats
eat
bats
eat
you
she
either
it
matter
which
way
she
put
felt
that
she
was
dozing
had
just
begun
to
dream
that
she
was
walking
hand
in
hand
with
saying
to
her
very
me
the
did
you
ever
eat
a
she
came
upon
a
heap
of
sticks
and
dry
the
fall
was
alice
was
not
a
bit
she
jumped
up
on
to
her
feet
in
a
she
looked
it
was
all
dark
her
was
another
long
the
white
rabbit
was
still
in
down
there
was
not
a
moment
to
be
went
alice
like
the
was
just
in
time
to
hear
it
it
turned
a
my
ears
and
late
she
was
close
behind
it
when
she
turned
the
the
rabbit
was
no
longer
to
be
found
herself
in
a
was
lit
up
by
a
row
of
lamps
hanging
from
the
there
were
doors
all
round
the
they
were
all
when
alice
had
been
all
the
way
down
one
side
and
up
the
every
walked
sadly
down
the
how
she
was
ever
to
get
out
suddenly
she
came
upon
a
little
all
made
of
solid
was
nothing
on
it
except
a
tiny
golden
first
thought
was
that
it
might
belong
to
one
of
the
doors
of
the
either
the
locks
were
too
the
key
was
too
but
at
any
rate
it
would
not
open
any
of
on
the
second
time
came
upon
a
low
curtain
she
had
not
noticed
behind
it
was
a
little
door
about
fifteen
inches
tried
the
little
golden
key
in
the
to
her
great
delight
it
alice
opened
the
door
and
found
that
it
led
into
a
small
much
larger
than
a
knelt
down
and
looked
along
the
passage
into
the
loveliest
garden
you
ever
she
longed
to
get
out
of
that
dark
wander
about
among
those
beds
of
bright
flowers
and
those
cool
she
could
not
even
get
her
head
through
the
even
if
my
head
would
go
poor
would
be
of
very
little
use
without
my
how
i
wish
i
could
shut
up
like
a
think
i
i
only
knew
how
to
many
had
happened
that
alice
had
begun
to
think
that
very
few
things
indeed
were
really
there
seemed
to
be
no
use
in
waiting
by
the
little
she
went
back
to
the
hoping
she
might
find
another
key
on
at
any
rate
a
book
of
rules
for
shutting
people
up
like
time
she
found
a
little
bottle
on
certainly
was
not
here
round
the
neck
of
the
bottle
was
a
paper
the
words
beautifully
printed
on
it
in
large
it
was
all
very
well
to
say
but
the
wise
little
alice
was
not
going
to
do
that
in
a
see
whether
she
had
read
several
nice
little
histories
about
children
who
had
got
eaten
up
by
wild
beasts
and
other
unpleasant
because
they
would
not
remember
the
simple
rules
their
friends
had
taught
a
poker
will
burn
you
if
you
hold
it
too
that
if
you
cut
your
finger
very
deeply
with
a
usually
she
had
never
forgotten
you
drink
much
from
a
bottle
marked
is
almost
certain
to
disagree
with
or
bottle
was
not
marked
alice
ventured
to
taste
finding
it
very
sort
of
mixed
flavour
of
and
hot
buttered
very
soon
finished
it
curious
must
be
shutting
up
like
a
and
so
it
was
was
now
only
ten
inches
her
face
brightened
up
at
the
thought
that
she
was
now
the
right
size
for
going
through
the
little
door
into
that
lovely
waited
for
a
few
minutes
to
see
if
she
was
going
to
shrink
any
she
felt
a
little
nervous
about
it
might
alice
to
my
going
out
a
wonder
what
i
should
be
like
she
tried
to
fancy
what
the
flame
of
a
candle
is
like
after
the
candle
is
blown
she
could
not
remember
ever
having
seen
such
a
after
a
that
nothing
more
decided
on
going
into
the
garden
at
alas
for
poor
she
got
to
the
found
she
had
forgotten
the
little
golden
when
she
went
back
to
the
table
for
found
she
could
not
possibly
reach
could
see
it
quite
plainly
through
the
she
tried
her
best
to
climb
up
one
of
the
legs
of
the
it
was
too
and
when
she
had
tired
herself
out
with
poor
little
thing
sat
down
and
no
use
in
crying
like
alice
to
rather
advise
you
to
leave
off
this
generally
gave
herself
very
good
she
very
seldom
followed
and
sometimes
she
scolded
herself
so
severely
as
to
bring
tears
into
her
once
she
remembered
trying
to
box
her
own
ears
for
having
cheated
herself
in
a
game
of
croquet
she
was
playing
against
for
this
curious
child
was
very
fond
of
pretending
to
be
two
no
use
poor
pretend
to
be
two
hardly
enough
of
me
left
to
make
one
respectable
soon
her
eye
fell
on
a
little
glass
box
that
was
lying
under
the
she
opened
found
in
it
a
very
small
which
the
words
were
beautifully
marked
in
if
it
makes
me
grow
can
reach
the
if
it
makes
me
grow
can
creep
under
the
either
way
get
into
the
i
which
she
ate
a
little
said
anxiously
to
her
hand
on
the
top
of
her
head
to
feel
which
way
it
was
she
was
quite
surprised
to
find
that
she
remained
the
same
be
generally
happens
when
one
eats
alice
had
got
so
much
into
the
way
of
expecting
nothing
but
things
to
it
seemed
quite
dull
and
stupid
for
life
to
go
on
in
the
common
so
she
set
to
very
soon
finished
off
the
chapter
pool
of
tears
alice
so
much
for
the
moment
she
quite
forgot
how
to
speak
good
opening
out
like
the
largest
telescope
that
ever
she
looked
down
at
her
seemed
to
be
almost
out
of
were
getting
so
far
my
poor
little
wonder
who
will
put
on
your
shoes
and
stockings
for
you
be
shall
be
a
great
deal
too
far
off
to
trouble
myself
about
must
manage
the
best
way
you
must
be
kind
to
perhaps
they
the
way
i
want
to
me
give
them
a
new
pair
of
boots
every
and
she
went
on
planning
to
herself
how
she
would
manage
must
go
by
the
how
funny
sending
presents
to
how
odd
the
directions
will
near
the
oh
nonsense
just
then
her
head
struck
against
the
roof
of
the
fact
she
was
now
more
than
nine
feet
she
at
once
took
up
the
little
golden
key
and
hurried
off
to
the
garden
poor
was
as
much
as
she
could
down
on
one
look
through
into
the
garden
with
one
to
get
through
was
more
hopeless
than
sat
down
and
began
to
cry
to
be
ashamed
of
great
girl
like
might
well
say
go
on
crying
in
this
this
tell
she
went
on
all
the
gallons
of
there
was
a
large
pool
all
round
four
inches
deep
and
reaching
half
down
the
after
a
time
she
heard
a
little
pattering
of
feet
in
the
she
hastily
dried
her
eyes
to
see
what
was
was
the
white
rabbit
a
pair
of
white
kid
gloves
in
one
hand
and
a
large
fan
in
the
came
trotting
along
in
a
great
to
himself
as
he
the
she
be
savage
if
her
felt
so
desperate
that
she
was
ready
to
ask
help
of
any
when
the
rabbit
came
near
a
you
the
rabbit
started
the
white
kid
gloves
and
the
and
skurried
away
into
the
darkness
as
hard
as
he
could
alice
took
up
the
fan
and
as
the
hall
was
very
kept
fanning
herself
all
the
time
she
went
on
queer
everything
is
yesterday
things
went
on
just
as
i
wonder
if
changed
in
the
me
i
the
same
when
i
got
up
this
almost
think
i
can
remember
feeling
a
little
if
the
next
question
in
the
world
am
great
she
began
thinking
over
all
the
children
she
knew
that
were
of
the
same
age
as
see
if
she
could
have
been
changed
for
any
of
her
hair
goes
in
such
long
mine
in
ringlets
at
i
be
i
know
all
sorts
of
she
knows
such
a
very
and
how
puzzling
it
all
try
if
i
know
all
the
things
i
used
to
me
times
five
is
four
times
six
is
four
times
seven
i
shall
never
get
to
twenty
at
that
multiplication
table
london
is
the
capital
of
paris

the
capital
of
all

have
been
changed
for
try
and
say
the
she
crossed
her
hands
on
her
lap
as
if
she
were
saying
began
to
repeat
but
her
voice
sounded
hoarse
and
the
words
did
not
come
the
same
as
they
used
to
the
little
crocodile
improve
his
shining
and
pour
the
waters
of
the
nile
on
every
golden
he
seems
to
how
neatly
spread
his
and
welcome
little
fishes
in
with
gently
smiling
those
are
not
the
right
poor
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
again
as
she
went
must
be
mabel
after
i
shall
have
to
go
and
live
in
that
poky
little
have
next
to
no
toys
to
play
so
many
lessons
to
made
up
my
mind
about
down
be
no
use
their
putting
their
heads
down
and
saying
i
shall
only
look
up
and
say
i
me
that
if
i
like
being
that
come
stay
down
here
till
a
sudden
burst
of
do
wish
they
would
put
their
heads
am
so
very
tired
of
being
all
alone
as
she
said
this
she
looked
down
at
her
was
surprised
to
see
that
she
had
put
on
one
of
the
white
kid
gloves
while
she
was
can
i
have
done
must
be
growing
small
got
up
and
went
to
the
table
to
measure
herself
by
found
nearly
as
she
could
was
now
about
two
feet
was
going
on
shrinking
soon
found
out
that
the
cause
of
this
was
the
fan
she
was
she
dropped
it
in
time
to
avoid
shrinking
away
a
narrow
good
deal
frightened
at
the
sudden
very
glad
to
find
herself
still
in
now
for
the
she
ran
with
all
speed
back
to
the
little
the
little
door
was
shut
the
little
golden
key
was
lying
on
the
glass
table
as
things
are
worse
than
thought
the
poor
i
never
was
so
small
as
this
and
i
declare
it
as
she
said
these
words
her
foot
in
another
she
was
up
to
her
chin
in
salt
first
idea
was
that
she
had
somehow
fallen
into
the
in
that
case
i
can
go
back
by
said
to
had
been
to
the
seaside
once
in
her
had
come
to
the
general
wherever
you
go
to
on
the
english
coast
you
find
a
number
of
bathing
machines
in
the
children
digging
in
the
sand
with
wooden
a
row
of
lodging
behind
them
a
railway
she
soon
made
out
that
she
was
in
the
pool
of
tears
which
she
had
wept
when
she
was
nine
feet
i
so
she
swam
to
find
her
way
shall
be
punished
for
it
being
drowned
in
my
own
will
be
a
queer
be
is
queer
just
then
she
heard
something
splashing
about
in
the
pool
a
little
way
she
swam
nearer
to
make
out
what
it
first
she
thought
it
must
be
a
walrus
or
then
she
remembered
how
small
she
was
she
soon
made
out
that
it
was
only
a
mouse
that
had
slipped
in
like
be
of
any
thought
speak
to
this
everything
is
so
i
should
think
very
likely
it
can
any
no
harm
in
she
you
know
the
way
out
of
this
am
very
tired
of
swimming
about
thought
this
must
be
the
right
way
of
speaking
to
a
had
never
done
such
a
thing
she
remembered
having
seen
in
her
a
mouse
looked
at
her
rather
seemed
to
her
to
wink
with
one
of
its
little
but
it
said
daresay
a
french
over
with
william
the
with
all
her
knowledge
of
had
no
very
clear
notion
how
long
ago
anything
had
she
began
est
ma
was
the
first
sentence
in
her
french
mouse
gave
a
sudden
leap
out
of
the
seemed
to
quiver
all
over
with
beg
your
alice
that
she
had
hurt
the
poor
forgot
you
the
a
you
like
cats
if
you
were
alice
in
a
soothing
be
angry
about
yet
i
wish
i
could
show
you
our
cat
think
take
a
fancy
to
cats
if
you
could
only
see
is
such
a
dear
quiet
went
to
she
swam
lazily
about
in
the
she
sits
purring
so
nicely
by
the
her
paws
and
washing
her
is
such
a
nice
soft
thing
to
such

cried
alice
in
a
sorrowful
afraid
it
the
mouse
was
swimming
away
from
her
as
hard
as
it
could
making
quite
a
commotion
in
the
pool
as
it
so
she
called
softly
after

and
a
a
lory
and
an
several
other
curious
led
the
the
whole
party
swam
to
the
chapter
a
long
tale
they
were
indeed
a
that
assembled
on
the
birds
with
draggled
animals
with
their
fur
clinging
close
to
all
dripping
and
the
first
question
of
course
to
get
dry
had
a
consultation
about
after
a
few
minutes
it
seemed
quite
natural
to
alice
to
find
herself
talking
familiarly
with
if
she
had
known
them
all
her
she
had
quite
a
long
argument
with
the
at
last
turned
would
only
am
older
than
must
know
this
alice
would
not
allow
without
knowing
how
old
it
as
the
lory
positively
refused
to
tell
its
was
no
more
to
be
at
last
the
seemed
to
be
a
person
of
authority
among
called
of

sat
down
at
a
large
the
mouse
in
the
kept
her
eyes
anxiously
fixed
on
she
felt
sure
she
would
catch
a
bad
cold
if
she
did
not
get
dry
very
the
mouse
with
an
important
you
all
is
the
driest
thing
i
all
you
the
cause

the
the
mouse
replied
rather

what

well
i
find
a
the
generally
a
frog
or
a
question
did
the
archbishop
the
mouse
did
not
notice
this
hurriedly
went
it
advisable
to
go
with
edgar
atheling
to
meet
william
and
offer
him
the
conduct
at
first
was
the
insolence
of
his
are
you
getting
on
to
alice
as
it
as
alice
in
a
melancholy
to
dry
me
at
the
dodo
to
its
move
that
the
meeting
the
immediate
adoption
of
more
energetic
said
the
the
meaning
of
half
those
long
i
you
do
the
eaglet
bent
down
its
head
to
hide
a
of
the
other
birds
tittered
was
going
to
the
dodo
in
an
offended
that
the
best
thing
to
get
us
dry
would
be
a
a
that
she
wanted
much
to
but
the
dodo
had
paused
as
if
it
thought
that
somebody
ought
to
and
no
one
else
seemed
inclined
to
say
the
best
way
to
explain
it
is
to
do
as
you
might
like
to
try
the
thing
winter
will
tell
you
how
the
dodo
managed
first
it
marked
out
a
a
sort
of
exact
shape
it
then
all
the
party
were
placed
along
the
and
was
no
they
began
running
when
they
left
off
when
they
that
it
was
not
easy
to
know
when
the
race
was
when
they
had
been
running
half
an
hour
or
were
quite
dry
the
dodo
suddenly
called
out
is
they
all
crowded
round
and
who
has
this
question
the
dodo
could
not
answer
without
a
great
deal
of
and
it
sat
for
a
long
time
with
one
finger
pressed
upon
its
forehead
in
which
you
usually
see
the
pictures
of
the
rest
waited
in
last
the
dodo
all
must
have
is
to
give
the
a
chorus
of
voices
of
the
to
alice
with
one
and
the
whole
party
at
once
crowded
round
out
in
a
confused
alice
had
no
idea
what
to
in
despair
she
put
her
hand
in
her
pulled
out
a
box
of
the
salt
water
had
not
got
into
handed
them
round
as
was
exactly
one
must
have
a
prize
the
the
dodo
replied
very
else
have
you
got
in
your
went
to
alice
over
the
then
they
all
crowded
round
her
once
the
dodo
solemnly
presented
the
your
acceptance
of
this
elegant
when
it
had
finished
this
short
all
alice
thought
the
whole
thing
very
they
all
looked
so
grave
that
she
did
not
dare
to
as
she
could
not
think
of
anything
to
simply
took
the
as
solemn
as
she
the
next
thing
was
to
eat
the
caused
some
noise
and
the
large
birds
complained
that
they
could
not
taste
the
small
ones
choked
and
had
to
be
patted
on
the
was
over
at
they
sat
down
again
in
a
begged
the
mouse
to
tell
them
something
to
tell
me
your
why

added
in
a
afraid
that

would
be
offended
a
long
and
a
sad
the
to
a
long
said
down
with
wonder
at
the
do
you
call
it
she
kept
on
puzzling
about
it
while
the
mouse
was
that
her
idea
of
the
tale
was
something
like
to
a
he
met

a

off
at
old
magpie

wrapping
itself
up

must
be
getting
my
a
canary

voice

its
high
time

alice
began
to

felt
very
lonely
and
a
little

again
heard
a
little
pattering
of
footsteps
in
the
she
looked
up
hoping
that
the
mouse
had
changed

coming
back
to
finish

a
little
bill

anxiously
about

it
if

she
heard
it
muttering
to
itself
the
my
dear
my
fur
and
get
me
sure
as
ferrets
are
can
i
have
dropped
guessed
in
a
moment
that
it
was
looking
for
the
fan
and
the
pair
of
white
kid
and
she
very
hunting
about
for
they
were
nowhere
to
be
to
have
changed
since
her
swim
in
the
the
great
the
glass
table
and
the
little
had
vanished
very
soon
the
rabbit
noticed
she
went
hunting

out
to
her
in
an
angry
mary

you
doing
out
home
this
fetch
me
a
pair
of
gloves
and
a
and
alice
was
so
much
frightened
that
she
ran
off
at
once
in
the
direction
it
pointed
trying
to
explain
the
mistake
it
had
me
for
his
said
to
herself
as
she
surprised
when
he
finds
out
who

take
him

fan
and
if
i
can
find
she
said
came
upon
a
neat
little
the
door
of
which
was
a
bright
brass
plate
with
the
name
engraved
upon
went
in
without
hurried
great
fear
lest
she
should
meet
the
real
mary
be
turned
out
of
the
house
before
she
had
found
the
fan
and
it
said
to
be
going
messages
for
a
suppose
sending
me
on
messages
she
began
fancying
the
sort
of
thing
that
would
here
get
ready
for
your
in
a
to
see
that
the
mouse
i
went
dinah
stop
in
the
house
if
it
began
ordering
people
about
like
by
this
time
she
had
found
her
way
into
a
tidy
little
room
with
a
table
in
the
on
it
had
fan
and
two
or
three
pairs
of
tiny
white
kid
took
up
the
fan
and
a
pair
of
the
and
was
just
going
to
leave
the
her
eye
fell
upon
a
little
bottle
that
stood
near
the
was
no
label
this
time
with
the
words
but
nevertheless
she
uncorked
it
and
put
it
to
her
know
something
interesting
is
sure
to
said
to
i
eat
or
drink
see
what
this
bottle
do
hope
me
grow
large
really
tired
of
being
such
a
tiny
little
it
did
so
much
sooner
than
she
had
she
had
drunk
half
the
found
her
head
pressing
against
the
and
had
to
stoop
to
save
her
neck
from
being
hastily
put
down
the
to
herself
i
grow
any
out
at
the
wish
i
drunk
quite
so
was
too
late
to
wish
went
on
and
very
soon
had
to
kneel
down
on
the
another
minute
there
was
not
even
room
for
she
tried
the
effect
of
lying
down
with
one
elbow
against
the
the
other
arm
curled
round
her
still
she
went
on
as
a
last
put
one
arm
out
of
the
one
foot
up
the
said
to
herself
can
do
no
will
become
of
luckily
for
little
magic
bottle
had
now
had
its
full
and
she
grew
no
it
was
very
as
there
seemed
to
be
no
sort
of
chance
of
her
ever
getting
out
of
the
room
wonder
she
felt
much
pleasanter
at
poor
one
always
growing
larger
and
being
ordered
about
by
mice
and
almost
wish
i
down
that
sort
of
do
wonder
what
can
have
happened
to
i
used
to
read
fancied
that
kind
of
thing
never
now
here
i
am
in
the
middle
of
there
ought
to
be
a
book
written
about
there
when
i
grow
write
grown
up
added
in
a
sorrowful
least
room
to
grow
up
any
more
thought
i
never
get
any
older
than
i
am
be
a
be
an
old
have
lessons
to
i
foolish
answered
can
you
learn
lessons
in
room
for
no
room
at
all
for
any
and
so
she
went
first
one
side
and
then
the
making
quite
a
conversation
of
it
after
a
few
minutes
she
heard
a
voice
stopped
to
mary
the
me
my
gloves
this
then
came
a
little
pattering
of
feet
on
the
knew
it
was
the
rabbit
coming
to
look
for
she
trembled
till
she
shook
the
forgetting
that
she
was
now
about
a
thousand
times
as
large
as
the
had
no
reason
to
be
afraid
of
presently
the
rabbit
came
up
to
the
tried
to
open
as
the
door
opened
was
pressed
hard
against
that
attempt
proved
a
heard
it
say
to
itself
go
round
and
get
in
at
the
after
waiting
till
she
fancied
she
heard
the
rabbit
just
under
the
suddenly
spread
out
her
made
a
snatch
in
the
did
not
get
hold
of
but
she
heard
a
little
shriek
and
a
a
crash
of
broken
from
which
she
concluded
that
it
was
just
possible
it
had
fallen
into
a
something
of
the
next
came
an
angry
are
then
a
voice
she
had
never
heard
then
digging
for
said
the
rabbit
come
and
help
me
out
of
of
more
broken
in
the
an
pronounced
it
you
ever
saw
one
that
it
fills
the
whole
arm
for
all
got
no
business
any
and
take
it
there
was
a
long
silence
after
alice
could
only
hear
whispers
now
and
i
as
i
tell
at
last
she
spread
out
her
hand
made
another
snatch
in
the
time
there
were
two
little
more
sounds
of
broken
a
number
of
must
wonder
what
for
pulling
me
out
of
the
only
wish
they
sure
i
to
stay
in
here
any
she
waited
for
some
time
without
hearing
anything
last
came
a
rumbling
of
little
the
sound
of
a
good
many
voices
all
talking
made
out
the
the
other
bring
but
got
the
fetch
it
put
at
this
together
reach
half
high
enough
do
well
be
catch
hold
of
this
roof
loose
coming
loud
did
go
down
the
do
to
go
the
master
says
go
down
the
to
come
down
the
alice
to
they
seem
to
put
everything
upon
in
for
a
good
fireplace
is
be
i
think
i
can
kick
a
she
drew
her
foot
as
far
down
the
chimney
as
she
waited
till
she
heard
a
little
animal
guess
of
what
sort
it
scratching
and
scrambling
about
in
the
chimney
close
above
saying
to
herself
gave
one
sharp
waited
to
see
what
would
happen
the
first
thing
she
heard
was
a
general
chorus
of
then
the
you
by
the
then
another
confusion
of
his
happened
to
us
all
about
last
came
a
little
i
hardly
thank
better
a
deal
too
flustered
to
tell
know
comes
at
me
like
a
up
i
goes
like
a
the
burn
the
house
the
and
alice
called
out
as
loud
as
she
you
set
dinah
at
there
was
a
dead
silence
alice
thought
to
wonder
what
they
will
do
they
had
any
take
the
roof
a
minute
or
began
moving
about
alice
heard
the
rabbit
barrowful
will
begin
of
she
had
not
long
to
for
the
next
moment
a
shower
of
little
pebbles
came
rattling
in
at
the
some
of
them
hit
her
in
the
put
a
stop
to
she
said
to
shouted
better
not
do
that
which
produced
another
dead
alice
noticed
with
some
surprise
that
the
pebbles
were
all
turning
into
little
cakes
as
they
lay
on
the
a
bright
idea
came
into
her
i
eat
one
of
these
sure
to
make
some
change
in
my
as
it
make
me
must
make
me
so
she
swallowed
one
of
the
was
delighted
to
find
that
she
began
shrinking
soon
as
she
was
small
enough
to
get
through
the
ran
out
of
the
found
quite
a
crowd
of
little
animals
and
birds
waiting
poor
little
was
in
the
held
up
by
two
were
giving
it
something
out
of
a
all
made
a
rush
at
alice
the
moment
she
she
ran
off
as
hard
as
she
soon
found
herself
safe
in
a
thick
thing
to
alice
to
she
wandered
about
in
the
to
grow
to
my
right
size
the
second
thing
is
to
find
my
way
into
that
lovely
think
that
will
be
the
best
it
sounded
an
excellent
very
neatly
and
simply
only
difficulty
she
had
not
the
smallest
idea
how
to
set
about
while
she
was
peering
about
anxiously
among
the
little
sharp
bark
just
over
her
head
made
her
look
up
in
a
great
an
enormous
puppy
was
looking
down
at
her
with
large
round
feebly
stretching
out
one
to
touch
little
said
a
coaxing
she
tried
hard
to
whistle
to
she
was
terribly
frightened
all
the
time
at
the
thought
that
it
might
be
which
case
it
would
be
very
likely
to
eat
her
up
in
spite
of
all
her
hardly
knowing
what
she
picked
up
a
little
bit
of
held
it
out
to
the
the
puppy
jumped
into
the
air
off
all
its
feet
at
a
yelp
of
rushed
at
the
and
made
believe
to
worry
alice
dodged
behind
a
great
to
keep
herself
from
being
run
the
moment
she
appeared
on
the
other
puppy
made
another
rush
at
the
tumbled
head
over
heels
in
its
hurry
to
get
hold
of
it
was
very
like
having
a
game
of
play
with
a
expecting
every
moment
to
be
trampled
under
its
round
the
thistle
the
puppy
began
a
series
of
short
charges
at
the
a
very
little
way
forwards
each
time
and
a
long
way
barking
hoarsely
all
the
at
last
it
sat
down
a
good
way
with
its
tongue
hanging
out
of
its
its
great
eyes
half
this
seemed
to
alice
a
good
opportunity
for
making
her
she
set
off
at
ran
till
she
was
quite
tired
and
out
of
till
the
sounded
quite
faint
in
the
what
a
dear
little
puppy
it
she
leant
against
a
buttercup
to
rest
fanned
herself
with
one
of
the
should
have
liked
teaching
it
tricks
very
only
been
the
right
size
to
do
nearly
forgotten
that
to
grow
up
me
it
to
be
suppose
i
ought
to
eat
or
drink
something
or
the
great
question
the
great
question
certainly
alice
looked
all
round
her
at
the
flowers
and
the
blades
of
she
did
not
see
anything
that
looked
like
the
right
thing
to
eat
or
drink
under
the
there
was
a
large
mushroom
growing
near
the
same
height
as
when
she
had
looked
under
on
both
sides
of
behind
occurred
to
her
that
she
might
as
well
look
and
see
what
was
on
the
top
of
she
stretched
herself
up
on
peeped
over
the
edge
of
the
her
eyes
immediately
met
those
of
a
large
that
was
sitting
on
the
top
with
its
arms
smoking
a
long
taking
not
the
smallest
notice
of
her
or
of
anything
chapter
from
a
caterpillar
the
caterpillar
and
alice
looked
at
each
other
for
some
time
in
at
last
the
caterpillar
took
the
hookah
out
of
its
addressed
her
in
a
the
this
was
not
an
encouraging
opening
for
a
rather
hardly
just
at
i
know
who
i
was
when
i
got
up
this
i
think
i
must
have
been
changed
several
times
since
you
mean
by
the
caterpillar
explain
said
the
i
it
more
replied
very
it
myself
to
begin
being
so
many
different
sizes
in
a
day
is
very
said
the
you
it
so
when
you
have
to
turn
into
a
some
after
that
into
a
should
think
it
a
little
the
your
feelings
may
be
i
know
would
feel
very
queer
to
the
caterpillar
are
which
brought
them
back
again
to
the
beginning
of
the
alice
felt
a
little
irritated
at
the
such
very
short
she
drew
herself
up
and
you
ought
to
tell
me
who
you
the
here
was
another
puzzling
as
alice
could
not
think
of
any
good
as
the
caterpillar
seemed
to
be
in
a
very
unpleasant
state
of
turned
the
caterpillar
called
after
something
important
to
this
sounded
alice
turned
and
came
back
the
down
her
anger
as
well
as
she
the
alice
thought
she
might
as
well
she
had
nothing
else
to
perhaps
after
all
it
might
tell
her
something
worth
some
minutes
it
puffed
away
without
at
last
it
unfolded
its
the
hookah
out
of
its
mouth
you
think
do
i
said
things
as
i
the
same
size
for
ten
minutes
what
the
tried
to
say
the
little
busy
it
all
came
replied
in
a
very
melancholy
are
the
alice
folded
her
young
man
hair
has
become
very
and
yet
you
incessantly
stand
on
your
do
you
your
is
william
replied
to
his
it
might
injure
the
that
sure
i
have
do
it
again
and
the
i
mentioned
and
have
grown
most
uncommonly
yet
you
turned
a
at

the
reason
of
the

shook
his
grey
all
my
limbs
very
supple
by
the
use
of
this

me
to
sell
you
a
the
your
jaws
are
too
weak
for
anything
tougher
than
yet
you
finished
the
the
bones
and
the
pray
how
did
you
manage
to
do
his
took
to
the
and
argued
each
case
with
my
and
the
muscular
it
gave
to
my
has
lasted
the
rest
of
my
the
would
hardly
suppose
that
your
eye
was
as
steady
as
yet
you
balanced
an
eel
on
the
end
of
your

made
you
so
awfully
answered
three
that
is
said
his
give
yourself
do
you
think
i
can
listen
all
day
to
such
be
you
down
not
said
the
the
words
have
got
wrong
from
beginning
to
the
caterpillar
there
was
silence
for
some
the
caterpillar
was
the
first
to
do
you
want
to
not
particular
as
to
hastily
one
changing
so
the
alice
said
had
never
been
so
much
contradicted
in
her
life
she
felt
that
she
was
losing
her
content
the
should
like
to
be
a
little
if
you
said
inches
is
such
a
wretched
height
to
a
very
good
height
the
caterpillar
itself
upright
as
it
spoke
exactly
three
inches
not
used
to
poor
alice
in
a
piteous
she
thought
of
wish
the
creatures
so
easily
used
to
it
in
the
it
put
the
hookah
into
its
mouth
and
began
smoking
this
time
alice
waited
patiently
until
it
chose
to
speak
a
minute
or
two
the
caterpillar
took
the
hookah
out
of
its
mouth
and
yawned
once
or
shook
it
got
down
off
the
crawled
away
in
the
remarking
as
it
will
make
you
grow
the
other
side
will
make
you
grow
of
other
side
of
alice
to
the
as
if
she
had
asked
it
in
another
moment
it
was
out
of
alice
remained
looking
thoughtfully
at
the
mushroom
for
a
to
make
out
which
were
the
two
sides
of
as
it
was
perfectly
found
this
a
very
difficult
at
last
she
stretched
her
arms
round
it
as
far
as
they
would
broke
off
a
bit
of
the
edge
with
each
which
is
said
to
nibbled
a
little
of
the
to
try
the
next
moment
she
felt
a
violent
blow
underneath
her
had
struck
her
she
was
a
good
deal
frightened
by
this
very
sudden
she
felt
that
there
was
no
time
to
be
she
was
shrinking
she
set
to
work
at
once
to
eat
some
of
the
other
chin
was
pressed
so
closely
against
her
there
was
hardly
room
to
open
her
she
did
it
at
managed
to
swallow
a
morsel
of
the
lefthand
at
alice
in
a
tone
of
changed
into
alarm
in
another
she
found
that
her
shoulders
were
nowhere
to
be
she
could
she
looked
an
immense
length
of
seemed
to
rise
like
a
stalk
out
of
a
sea
of
green
leaves
that
lay
far
below
all
that
green
stuff
where
have
my
shoulders
got
poor
is
it
i
she
was
moving
them
about
as
she
no
result
seemed
to
except
a
little
shaking
among
the
distant
green
as
there
seemed
to
be
no
chance
of
getting
her
hands
up
to
her
tried
to
get
her
head
down
to
was
delighted
to
find
that
her
neck
would
bend
about
easily
in
any
a
had
just
succeeded
in
curving
it
down
into
a
graceful
was
going
to
dive
in
among
the
she
found
to
be
nothing
but
the
tops
of
the
trees
under
which
she
had
been
a
sharp
hiss
made
her
draw
back
in
a
large
pigeon
had
flown
into
her
was
beating
her
violently
with
its
the
a
alice
me
say
the
in
a
more
subdued
and
added
with
a
kind
of
tried
every
nothing
seems
to
suit
the
least
idea
what
the
roots
of
pigeon
went
attending
to
those
no
pleasing
alice
was
more
and
more
she
thought
there
was
no
use
in
saying
anything
more
till
the
pigeon
had
it
enough
hatching
the
the
must
be
on
the
serpents
night
and
i
a
wink
of
sleep
these
three
sorry
was
beginning
to
see
its
as
the
highest
tree
in
the
the
its
voice
to
a
just
as
i
was
thinking
i
should
be
free
of
them
at
must
needs
come
wriggling
down
from
the
not
a
tell
are
the
can
see
to
invent
little
she
remembered
the
number
of
changes
she
had
gone
through
that
story
the
pigeon
in
a
tone
of
the
deepest
seen
a
good
many
little
girls
in
my
never
one
with
such
a
neck
as
a
use
denying
suppose
telling
me
next
that
you
never
tasted
an
tasted
said
was
a
very
truthful
little
girls
eat
eggs
quite
as
much
as
serpents
believe
the
if
they
then
a
kind
of
all
i
can
this
was
such
a
new
idea
to
she
was
quite
silent
for
a
minute
or
gave
the
pigeon
the
opportunity
of
looking
for
know
that
well
what
does
it
matter
to
me
whether
little
girl
or
a
a
good
deal
to
alice
looking
for
it
if
i
like
them
said
the
pigeon
in
a
sulky
it
settled
down
again
into
its
crouched
down
among
the
trees
as
well
as
she
her
neck
kept
getting
entangled
among
the
every
now
and
then
she
had
to
stop
and
untwist
a
while
she
remembered
that
she
still
held
the
pieces
of
mushroom
in
her
she
set
to
work
very
first
at
one
and
then
at
the
growing
sometimes
taller
and
sometimes
she
had
succeeded
in
bringing
herself
down
to
her
usual
it
was
so
long
since
she
had
been
anything
near
the
right
it
felt
quite
strange
at
she
got
used
to
it
in
a
few
and
began
talking
to
my
plan
done
puzzling
all
these
changes
never
sure
what
to
one
minute
to
back
to
my
right
next
thing
get
into
that
beautiful
that
to
be
she
said
came
suddenly
upon
an
open
a
little
house
in
it
about
four
feet
lives
never
do
to
come
upon
them
this
i
should
frighten
them
out
of
their
she
began
nibbling
at
the
righthand
bit
did
not
venture
to
go
near
the
house
till
she
had
brought
herself
down
to
nine
inches
chapter
and
pepper
for
a
minute
or
two
she
stood
looking
at
the
wondering
what
to
do
suddenly
a
footman
in
livery
came
running
out
of
the
him
to
be
a
footman
because
he
was
in
by
his
face
would
have
called
him
a
loudly
at
the
door
with
his
was
opened
by
another
footman
in
a
round
large
eyes
like
a
both
powdered
hair
that
curled
all
over
their
felt
very
curious
to
know
what
it
was
all
and
crept
a
little
way
out
of
the
wood
to
the
by
producing
from
under
his
arm
a
great
nearly
as
large
as
this
he
handed
over
to
the
a
solemn
the
invitation
from
the
queen
to
play
in
the
same
solemn
only
changing
the
order
of
the
words
a
the
invitation
for
the
duchess
to
play
then
they
both
bowed
their
curls
got
entangled
alice
laughed
so
much
at
she
had
to
run
back
into
the
wood
for
fear
of
their
hearing
when
she
next
peeped
out
the
the
other
was
sitting
on
the
ground
near
the
stupidly
up
into
the
alice
went
timidly
up
to
the
sort
of
use
in
the
that
for
two
because
the
same
side
of
the
door
as
you
because
such
a
noise
one
could
possibly
hear
certainly
there
was
a
most
extraordinary
noise
going
on
howling
and
every
now
and
then
a
great
if
a
dish
or
kettle
had
been
broken
to
said
am
i
to
get
be
some
sense
in
your
footman
went
on
without
attending
to
we
had
the
door
between
if
you
were
might
i
could
let
you
he
was
looking
up
into
the
sky
all
the
time
he
was
this
alice
thought
decidedly
perhaps
he
said
to
eyes
are
so
very
nearly
at
the
top
of
his
but
at
any
rate
he
might
answer
i
to
get
sit
footman
at
this
moment
the
door
of
the
house
a
large
plate
came
skimming
at
the
it
just
grazed
his
and
broke
to
pieces
against
one
of
the
trees
behind
the
footman
continued
in
the
same
as
if
nothing
had
i
to
get
alice
a
louder
to
get
in
at
the
the
first
it
alice
did
not
like
to
be
told
really
muttered
to
way
all
the
creatures
to
drive
one
the
footman
seemed
to
think
this
a
good
opportunity
for
repeating
his
shall
sit
and
days
and
am
i
to
the
began
no
use
in
talking
to
alice
perfectly
she
opened
the
door
and
went
the
door
led
right
into
a
large
was
full
of
smoke
from
one
end
to
the
duchess
was
sitting
on
a
in
the
a
cook
was
leaning
over
the
a
large
cauldron
which
seemed
to
be
full
of
too
much
pepper
in
that
said
to
as
well
as
she
could
for
there
was
certainly
too
much
of
it
in
the
the
duchess
sneezed
as
for
the
was
sneezing
and
howling
alternately
without
a
the
only
things
in
the
kitchen
that
did
not
the
a
large
cat
which
was
sitting
on
the
hearth
and
grinning
from
ear
to
you
tell
little
she
was
not
quite
sure
whether
it
was
good
manners
for
her
to
speak
your
cat
grins
like
cheshire
the
she
said
the
last
word
with
such
sudden
violence
that
alice
quite
she
saw
in
another
moment
that
it
was
addressed
to
the
and
not
to
she
took
went
on
know
that
cheshire
cats
always
that
cats
could
the
most
of
know
of
any
that
said
very
quite
pleased
to
have
got
into
a
know
the
alice
did
not
at
all
like
the
tone
of
this
thought
it
would
be
as
well
to
introduce
some
other
subject
of
she
was
trying
to
fix
on
cook
took
the
cauldron
of
soup
off
the
at
once
set
to
work
throwing
everything
within
her
reach
at
the
duchess
and
the
came
followed
a
shower
of
and
duchess
took
no
notice
of
them
even
when
they
hit
the
baby
was
howling
so
much
that
it
was
quite
impossible
to
say
whether
the
blows
hurt
it
or
mind
what
cried
up
and
down
in
an
agony
of
there
goes
his
precious
an
unusually
large
saucepan
flew
close
by
very
nearly
carried
it
minded
their
own
duchess
said
in
a
hoarse
world
would
go
round
a
deal
faster
than
it
not
be
an
felt
very
glad
to
get
an
opportunity
of
showing
off
a
little
of
her
think
of
what
work
it
would
make
with
the
day
and
see
the
earth
takes
to
turn
round
on
its
the
off
her
alice
glanced
rather
anxiously
at
the
see
if
she
meant
to
take
the
the
cook
was
busily
stirring
the
seemed
not
to
be
she
went
on
is
it
bother
the
never
could
abide
and
with
that
she
began
nursing
her
child
a
sort
of
lullaby
to
it
as
she
did
giving
it
a
violent
shake
at
the
end
of
every
to
your
little
and
beat
him
when
he
he
only
does
it
to
because
he
knows
it
the
cook
and
the
baby
while
the
duchess
sang
the
second
verse
of
the
kept
tossing
the
baby
violently
up
and
the
poor
little
thing
howled
that
alice
could
hardly
hear
the
severely
to
my
i
beat
him
when
he
for
he
can
thoroughly
enjoy
the
pepper
when
he
may
nurse
it
a
you
duchess
said
to
flinging
the
baby
at
her
as
she
must
go
and
get
ready
to
play
croquet
with
the
she
hurried
out
of
the
cook
threw
a
her
as
she
went
it
just
missed
alice
caught
the
baby
with
some
it
was
a
little
held
out
its
arms
and
legs
in
all
like
a
poor
little
thing
was
snorting
like
a
she
caught
kept
doubling
itself
up
and
straightening
itself
out
that
the
first
minute
or
was
as
much
as
she
could
do
to
hold
as
soon
as
she
had
made
out
the
proper
way
of
nursing
was
to
twist
it
up
into
a
sort
of
then
keep
tight
hold
of
its
right
ear
and
left
as
to
prevent
its
undoing
carried
it
out
into
the
open
i
this
child
away
with
thought
sure
to
kill
it
in
a
day
or
it
be
murder
to
leave
it
said
the
last
words
out
the
little
thing
grunted
in
reply
left
off
sneezing
by
this
said
not
at
all
a
proper
way
of
expressing
the
baby
grunted
alice
looked
very
anxiously
into
its
face
to
see
what
was
the
matter
with
could
be
no
doubt
that
it
had
a
very
much
more
like
a
snout
than
a
real
its
eyes
were
getting
extremely
small
for
a
alice
did
not
like
the
look
of
the
thing
at
perhaps
it
was
only
she
looked
into
its
eyes
see
if
there
were
any
were
no
to
turn
into
a
said
nothing
more
to
do
with
poor
little
thing
sobbed
again
it
was
impossible
to
say
they
went
on
for
some
while
in
alice
was
just
beginning
to
think
to
what
am
i
to
do
with
this
creature
when
i
get
it
it
grunted
that
she
looked
down
into
its
face
in
some
time
there
could
be
no
mistake
about
was
neither
more
nor
less
than
a
she
felt
that
it
would
be
quite
absurd
for
her
to
carry
it
so
she
set
the
little
creature
felt
quite
relieved
to
see
it
trot
away
quietly
into
the
it
had
grown
said
to
would
have
made
a
dreadfully
ugly
it
makes
rather
a
handsome
she
began
thinking
over
other
children
she
might
do
very
well
as
was
just
saying
to
one
only
knew
the
right
way
to
change
she
was
a
little
startled
by
seeing
the
cheshire
cat
sitting
on
a
bough
of
a
tree
a
few
yards
the
cat
only
grinned
when
it
saw
looked
it
had
very
long
claws
and
a
great
many
she
felt
that
it
ought
to
be
treated
with
she
she
did
not
at
all
know
whether
it
would
like
the
it
only
grinned
a
little
pleased
so
she
went
you
tell
which
way
i
ought
to
go
from
a
good
deal
on
where
you
want
to
get
the
much
care
which
way
you
the
as
i
get
added
as
an
sure
to
do
the
you
only
walk
long
alice
felt
that
this
could
not
be
she
tried
another
of
people

about

right

of
the
the
nearly
forgotten

into

quietly
as
if

come
back
in
a
natural
it
the

alice
waited
a
expecting
to

not
after
a
minute
or
two
she
walked

in
the
direction
in
which

by
the
white
was
peeping
anxiously
into
her
the
said
the
rabbit
in
a
looked
anxiously
over
his
shoulder
as
he
then
raised
himself
upon
his
mouth
close
to
her
whispered
sentence
of
said
say
rabbit
all
a
said
the
the
rabbit
gave
a
little
scream
of
rabbit
whispered
in
a
frightened
queen
will
hear
came
rather
the
queen
your
the
queen
in
a
voice
of
people
began
running
about
in
all
up
against
each
they
got
settled
down
in
a
minute
or
the
game
thought
she
had
never
seen
such
a
curious
her
was
all
ridges
and
balls
were
live
the
mallets
live
the
soldiers
had
to
double
themselves
up
and
to
stand
on
their
hands
and
make
the
the
chief
difficulty
alice
found
at
first
was
in
managing
her
she
succeeded
in
getting
its
body
tucked
her
its
legs
hanging
as
she
had
got
its
neck
nicely
straightened
was
going
to
give
the
hedgehog
a
blow
with
its
would
twist
itself
round
and
look
up
in
her
with
such
a
puzzled
expression
that
she
could
not
help
bursting
out
when
she
had
got
its
head
was
going
to
begin
was
very
provoking
to
find
that
the
hedgehog
had
unrolled
was
in
the
act
of
crawling
all
was
generally
a
ridge
or
furrow
in
the
way
wherever
she
wanted
to
send
the
hedgehog
as
the
were
always
getting
up
and
walking
off
to
other
parts
of
the
soon
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
a
very
difficult
game
the
players
all
played
at
once
without
waiting
for
all
the
fighting
for
the
in
a
very
short
time
the
queen
was
in
a
furious
went
stamping
shouting
his
her
once
in
a
alice
began
to
feel
very
be
had
not
as
yet
had
any
dispute
with
the
she
knew
that
it
might
happen
any
thought
would
become
of
dreadfully
fond
of
beheading
people
great
wonder
one
left
she
was
looking
about
for
some
way
of
wondering
whether
she
could
get
away
without
being
she
noticed
a
curious
appearance
in
the
puzzled
her
very
much
at
after
watching
it
a
minute
or
made
it
out
to
be
a
she
said
to
herself
cheshire
i
shall
have
somebody
to
talk
you
getting
the
soon
as
there
was
mouth
enough
for
it
to
speak
alice
waited
till
the
eyes
then
no
use
speaking
to
its
ears
have
at
least
one
of
another
minute
the
whole
head
then
alice
put
down
her
began
an
account
of
the
very
glad
she
had
someone
to
listen
to
cat
seemed
to
think
that
there
was
enough
of
it
now
in
no
more
of
it
think
they
play
at
all
rather
a
complaining
they
all
quarrel
so
dreadfully
one
oneself
to
have
any
rules
in
at
there
attends
to
no
idea
how
confusing
it
is
all
the
things
being
the
arch
to
go
through
next
walking
about
at
the
other
end
of
the
should
have
croqueted
the
just
it
ran
away
when
it
saw
mine
you
like
the
the
cat
in
a
low
so
then
she
noticed
that
the
queen
was
close
behind
so
she
went
worth
while
finishing
the
the
queen
smiled
and
passed
you
talking
the
up
to
looking
at
the
with
great
friend
of
me
to
introduce
like
the
look
of
it
at
the
it
may
kiss
my
hand
if
it
cat
the
at
me
like
he
got
behind
alice
as
he
may
look
at
a
read
that
in
some
but
i
must
be
the
king
very
he
called
the
was
passing
at
the
wish
you
would
have
this
cat
the
queen
had
only
one
way
of
settling
all
or
his
even
looking
the
executioner
the
king
he
hurried
alice
thought
she
might
as
well
go
see
how
the
game
was
going
she
heard
the
in
the
with
had
already
heard
her
sentence
three
of
the
players
to
be
executed
for
having
missed
their
she
did
not
like
the
look
of
things
at
the
game
was
in
such
confusion
that
she
never
knew
whether
it
was
her
turn
or
she
went
in
search
of
her
the
hedgehog
was
engaged
in
a
fight
with
another
seemed
to
alice
an
excellent
opportunity
for
croqueting
one
of
them
with
the
only
difficulty
her
flamingo
was
gone
across
to
the
other
side
of
the
alice
could
see
it
trying
in
a
helpless
sort
of
way
to
fly
up
into
a
by
the
time
she
had
caught
the
flamingo
and
brought
it
fight
was
both
the
hedgehogs
were
out
of
it
matter
all
the
arches
are
gone
from
this
side
of
the
she
tucked
it
away
under
her
it
might
not
escape
went
back
for
a
little
more
conversation
with
her
when
she
got
back
to
the
cheshire
was
surprised
to
find
quite
a
large
crowd
collected
round
was
a
dispute
going
on
between
the
the
were
all
talking
at
while
all
the
rest
were
quite
looked
very
the
moment
alice
was
appealed
to
by
all
three
to
settle
the
they
repeated
their
arguments
to
as
they
all
spoke
at
found
it
very
hard
indeed
to
make
out
exactly
what
they
the
you
off
a
head
unless
there
was
a
body
to
cut
it
off
he
had
never
had
to
do
such
a
thing
he
to
begin
at
his
time
of
the
anything
that
had
a
head
could
be
that
you
talk
the
if
something
about
it
in
less
than
no
time
everybody
was
this
last
remark
that
had
made
the
whole
party
look
so
grave
and
alice
could
think
of
nothing
else
to
say
but
to
the
ask
her
about
queen
said
to
the
her
and
the
executioner
went
off
like
an
the
began
fading
away
the
moment
he
was
by
the
time
he
had
come
back
with
the
had
entirely
the
king
and
the
executioner
ran
wildly
up
and
down
looking
for
the
rest
of
the
party
went
back
to
the
chapter
mock
think
how
glad
i
am
to
see
you
dear
old
said
the
she
tucked
her
arm
affectionately
into
they
walked
off
alice
was
very
glad
to
find
her
in
such
a
pleasant
thought
to
herself
that
perhaps
it
was
only
the
pepper
that
had
made
her
so
savage
when
they
met
in
the
a
said
to
in
a
very
hopeful
tone
any
pepper
in
my
kitchen
at
does
very
well
always
pepper
that
makes
people
she
went
much
pleased
at
having
found
out
a
new
kind
of
vinegar
that
makes
them
that
makes
them
and
such
things
that
make
children
only
wish
people
knew
they
so
stingy
about
she
had
quite
forgotten
the
duchess
by
this
was
a
little
startled
when
she
heard
her
voice
close
to
her
thinking
about
that
makes
you
forget
to
tell
you
just
now
what
the
moral
of
that
i
shall
remember
it
in
a
alice
ventured
to
the
got
a
only
you
can
find
she
squeezed
herself
up
closer
to
as
she
alice
did
not
much
like
keeping
so
close
to
because
the
duchess
was
very
she
was
exactly
the
right
height
to
rest
her
chin
upon
and
it
was
an
uncomfortably
sharp
she
did
not
like
to
be
she
bore
it
as
well
as
she
going
on
rather
better
way
of
keeping
up
the
conversation
a
said
the
the
moral
of
that
that
makes
the
world
go
alice
by
everybody
minding
their
own
it
means
much
the
same
the
her
sharp
little
chin
into
as
she
the
moral
of
that
of
the
the
sounds
will
take
care
of
she
is
of
finding
morals
in
thought
to
say
why
i
my
arm
round
your
the
duchess
said
after
a
reason
about
the
temper
of
your
i
try
the
cautiously
feeling
at
all
anxious
to
have
the
experiment
said
the
and
mustard
both
the
moral
of
that
a
feather
flock
the
a
clear
way
you
have
of
putting
it
the
seemed
ready
to
agree
to
everything
that
alice
a
large
the
moral
of
that
there
is
of
less
there
is
of
had
not
attended
to
this
last
like
it
agree
with
the
the
moral
of
that
you
would
seem
to
it
put
more
yourself
not
to
be
otherwise
than
what
it
might
appear
to
others
that
what
you
were
or
might
have
been
was
not
otherwise
than
what
you
had
been
would
have
appeared
to
them
to
be
i
should
understand
that
said
very
i
had
it
written
i
follow
it
as
you
say
to
what
i
could
say
if
i
duchess
a
pleased
trouble
yourself
to
say
it
any
longer
than
talk
about
the
make
you
a
present
of
everything
as
sort
of
glad
they
birthday
presents
like
she
did
not
venture
to
say
it
out
the
duchess
another
dig
of
her
sharp
little
right
to
alice
she
was
beginning
to
feel
a
little
as
much
the
pigs
have
to
the
but
died
in
the
middle
of
her
favourite
word
the
arm
that
was
linked
into
hers
began
to
looked
there
stood
the
queen
in
front
of
her
arms
like
a
duchess
began
in
a
give
you
fair
the

the
ground
as
she

or
your
head

be

too
much
frightened

back
to

the
other
guests

taken
advantage
of
the
and
were
resting
in
the
the
moment
they
saw
hurried
back
to
the
queen
merely
remarking
that
a
would
cost
them
their
all
the
time
they
were
playing
the
queen
never
left
off
quarrelling
with
the
other
shouting
his
her
whom
she
sentenced
were
taken
into
custody
by
the
who
of
course
had
to
leave
off
being
arches
to
do
that
by
the
end
of
half
an
hour
or
so
there
were
no
arches
all
the
the
in
custody
and
under
sentence
of
then
the
queen
left
out

said
to

what
a
mock

in
a
low
to
the
company

all

said
to
she
had
felt
quite
unhappy
at
the
number
of
executions
the
queen
had
they
very
soon
came
upon
a
fast
asleep
in
the
what
a
gryphon
at
the
lazy

take
this
young

she
walked
alice
alone
with
the

not
quite

the
look
of
the
on
the
whole
she
thought
it
would
be
quite
as
safe
to
stay
with
it
as
to
go
after
that
savage
she
the
gryphon
sat
up
and
rubbed
its
it
watched
the
queen
till
she
was
out
of
it
the
half
to
to
the
said
the
all
her
they
never
executes
she
went
slowly
after
never
was
so
ordered
about
in
all
my
they
had
not
gone
far
before
they
saw
the
mock
turtle
in
the
sitting
sad
and
lonely
on
a
little
ledge
of
as
they
came
could
hear
him
sighing
as
if
his
heart
would
pitied
him

his
asked
the
the
gryphon
nearly
in
the
same
words
as
all
his

they
went
up
to
the
mock
looked
at
them
with
large
eyes
full
of
said
young

she
waited

a
deep
was
a
real
these
words
were
followed
by
a
very
long
only
by
an
occasional
exclamation
of
the
the
constant
heavy
sobbing
of
the
mock
was
very
nearly
getting
up
and
for
your
interesting
she
could
not
help
thinking
there
must
be
more
to
she
sat
still
and
said

what

sat
still
just
as
she
left
her
head
on
her
the
setting
thinking
of
little
alice
and
all
her
wonderful
she
too
began
dreaming
after
a
this
was
her
dreamed
of
little
alice
once
again
the
tiny
hands
were
clasped
upon
her
the
bright
eager
eyes
were
looking
up
into
hear
the
very
tones
of
her
see
that
queer
little
toss
of
her
head
to
keep
back
the
wandering
hair
that
would
always
get
into
her
as
she
seemed
to
whole
place
around
her
became
alive
with
the
strange
creatures
of
her
little
the
long
grass
rustled
at
her
feet
as
the
white
rabbit
hurried
frightened
mouse
splashed
his
way
through
the
neighbouring
could
hear
the
rattle
of
the
teacups
as
the
march
hare
and
his
friends
shared
their
and
the
shrill
voice
of
the
queen
ordering
off
her
unfortunate
guests
to
the
was
sneezing
on
the
while
plates
and
dishes
crashed
around

with

sobs
of

miserable
mock
so

closed
half
believed

in

to
open
them
all
would
change
to
dull
would
be
only
rustling
in
the
the
pool
rippling
to
the
waving
of
the
teacups
would
change
to
tinkling
the
cries
to
the
voice
of
the
shepherd
sneeze
of
the
shriek
of
the
all
the
other
queer
change
the
confused
clamour
of
the
busy
lowing
of
the
cattle
in
the
distance
would
take
the
place
of
the
mock
heavy
pictured
to
herself
how

little
sister
of
hers

herself
a
grown
how
she
would

riper
simple
and
loving
heart
of
her
how
she
would
gather
about
her
other
little
make
their
eyes
bright
and
eager
with
many
a
strange
even
with
the
dream
of
wonderland
of

find

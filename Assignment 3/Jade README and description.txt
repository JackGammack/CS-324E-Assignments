For a3_novelvisualization, I chose the font "Vollkorn" for its storybook look to fit Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. Fonts with serifs, such as this one, are commonly used in printed novels because they are easier for the eye to focus on. The colors of the word cloud are white, yellow, and blue for the popping colors of Alice - her white apron and tights, blue dress and eyes, and blonde hair. The black background allows these colors to stand out and are also reminiscent of her black shoes and hairband, completing her character color palette.
Each word in the word cloud appears with a random color out of the 3 colors.
